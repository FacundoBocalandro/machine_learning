## Part 1

### Please use the space provided between the questions to answer them.

### 1. What is supervised ML?

In supervised ML you are given n PAIRS of data points. The variables have a relationship, the problem is to discover it.

### 2. What is unsupervised ML?

In unsupervised ML you are given n data points. The problem consists in discovering the pattern between the different values of the variable.

### 3. What is regression?



### 4. What is classification?



### 5. What is a predictor? Assume that x ∈ Rd and y ∈ R.



### 6. What is sample error?



### 7. Write the expression for sample error for regression for the squared error loss.


Ls(h) =


### 8. Write the expression for sample error for classification



### 9. What is training?



### 10. What is generalization error?



### 11. What is the No Free Lunch Theorem?



### 12. What is Occam’s Razor?



### 13. The following are important for successful training (check all that are valid):

- Large training data size
- Identical x − y relationship across training and generalization.
- Avoiding overfitting.

## Part 2

### 1. What is a linear predictor? Assume that x ∈ Rp and y ∈ R

A linear predictor is a linear function of its variables (x and y), which is used to predict values of the dependent variable (y).

### 2. What is a linear predictor assuming that p = 2?

Is a linear predictor of 2 variables. Each data point will consist of a pair of values, and will be the input to the linear predictor function.

### 3. Write the expression for the sample error of a linear predictor using the squared error loss for general p?



### 4. Write the expression for the sample error of a linear predictor for the squared error loss for p = 2?



### 5. How do you train a linear predictor for linear regression or ordinary least square?



### 6. Derive the optimal solution for linear regression or ordinary least square for the case of p = 1.



## Part 3

### 1. How do you define the inverse of a square matrix?



### 2. What is the definition of a gradient?



### 3. What is the definition of a Hessian?



### 4. Define a convex set



### 5. Define a convex function.



### 6. What is a positive semidefinite matrix?



### 7. How do you check if a function is convex using its Hessian?



### 8. How do you minimize a convex differentiable function?



### 9. Define the concept of linear independence.



### 10. What do we store in the matrix X and the vector Y? Provide precise expressions.
